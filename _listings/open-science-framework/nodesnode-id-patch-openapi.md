  title: Open Science Framework Update a node
  description: |-
    Updates a node by setting the values of the attributes specified in the request body. Any unspecified attributes will be left unchanged.

    Nodes can be updated with either a **PUT** or **PATCH** request. The `title` and `category` fields are mandatory in a **PUT** request, and optional in a **PATCH**.
    #### Permissions
    Only write contributors may update a node. Attempting to update a node for which you do not have write access will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.
    #### Returns
    Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the new representation of the updated node, if the request is successful.

    If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

      summary: List all affiliated nodes
      description: |-
        A paginated list of all nodes affiliated with an institution.
        #### Versioning
        As of version `2.2`, affiliated components (in addition to affiliated top-level projects) are returned from this endpoint.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate nodes object.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/institutions/cos/nodes?filter[title]=science.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `category`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `contributors`, and `preprint`

  /nodes/:
    get:
      summary: List all nodes
      description: |-
        A paginated list of nodes, representing projects and components, on the OSF.

        The returned nodes are those which are public or which the user has access to view.

        The returned nodes are sorted by their `date_modified`, with the most recently updated nodes appearing first.

        Registrations cannot be accessed through this endpoint (use the [registrations](#Registrations_registrations_list) endpoints instead).
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object containing `data` and `links` keys.

        The `data` key contains an array of 10 nodes. Each resource in the array is a separate node object and contains the full representation of the node, meaning additional requests to a node's detail view are not necessary.

        The `links` key contains a dictionary of links that can be used for [pagination](#Introduction_pagination).

        This request should never return an error.
        #### Filtering
        You can optionally request that the response only include nodes that match your filters by utilizing the `filter` query parameter, e.g. https://api.osf.io/v2/nodes/?filter[title]=reproducibility.

        Nodes may be filtered by their `id`, `title`, `category`, `description`, `public`, `tags`, `date_created`, `date_modified`, `root`, `parent`, `preprint`, and `contributors`.

        Most fields are string fields and will be filtered using simple substring matching. Public and preprint are boolean fields, and can be filtered using truthy values, such as **true**, **false**, **0** or **1**. Note that quoting true or false in the query will cause the match to fail.

    post:
      summary: Create a node
      description: |-
        Creates a new node.

        On the OSF, nodes are considered **projects** or **components**. The difference between a project and a component is that a project is a top-level node, and a component is a child of a project.

        Additionally, nodes have a `category` field that includes **project** as an option. The categorization determines what icon is displayed with the node on the OSF, and helps with search organization. Projects (top-level nodes) may have a category other than project, and components (children) may have a category of **project**.
        #### Required
        Required fields for creating a node include:

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`title`

        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp`category`

        Note: Nodes default to **private** unless the `public` field is explicitly set to **true** in the request payload.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the created node, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

        Permanently deletes a node. This action cannot be undone.
        #### Permissions
        Only project administrators may delete a node. Attempting to delete a node for which you are not an administrator will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.
        #### Returns
        If the request is successful, no content is returned.

        If the request is unsuccessful, a JSON object with an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.

      description: |-
        Retrieves the details of a given node (project or component).
        #### Permissions
        Only project contributors may retrieve the details of a private node. Attempting to retreive a private node for which you are not a contributor will result in a **403 Forbidden** response.

        Authentication is not required to view the details of a public node, as public nodes give read-only access to everyone.
        #### Returns
        Returns a JSON object with a `data` key containing the representation of the requested node, if the request is successful.

        If the request is unsuccessful, an `errors` key containing information about the failure will be returned. Refer to the [list of error codes](#Introduction_error_codes) to understand why this request may have failed.
